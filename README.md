ARAGORN is a popular algorithm for tRNA prediction. This `morloc` package wraps
the [libaragorn](https://github.com/arendsee/libaragorn) library which in turn
is a re-factored version of Dean Laslett codebase. If you use this algorithm,
please cite the original paper:

Laslett, Dean, and Bjorn Canback. "ARAGORN, a program to detect tRNA genes and tmRNA genes in nucleotide sequences." Nucleic acids research 32.1 (2004): 11-16.
